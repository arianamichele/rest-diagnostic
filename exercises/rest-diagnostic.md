# REST Diagnostic

This file is a markdown file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text, and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

### Question 1

In your own words, define what REST is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is basically just a set of instructions that tell us how things are accessed and manipulated.
```

### Question 2

Imagine you are designing an API that will deal with a resource called
`movies`, what would the appropriate RESTful routes be for sending requests to
that API? Please list the path next to the HTTP verb it would be associated
with.

```md
/movies/:id
```

## Question 3

What are some of the benefits of using an architectural style like REST when
developing an API? When might you NOT want to use the RESTful style?

```md
architectural style may help us build the system quicker than building everything from scratch but you need to know all the constraints and limitations between the system which may create issues if unfamiliar.```
